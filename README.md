# OTP Guide

*While not required in a technical sense, a hardmod is* **strongly** *recommended.*

For now, this guide is only *theoretically* possible without a hardmod. Quite a bit more testing will be needed before this is even relatively safe to use without one.

If you are going to attempt this without one (do not - *random* **hard bricks** can and will happen, sometimes to a fault not of your own), follow all instructions to the letter and hope you are incredibly lucky. If you try this without a hardmod, do not complain when you end up with a multiple hundred dollar paperweight.

**Seriously, do not attempt without a hardmod.**

## Introduction

This is, to the best of my knowledge, the first public comprehensive guide to getting the console specific OTP for the 3DS.

This guide will take you through the steps of downgrading to version 2.1 to get the OTP, which was blocked from our reach with the release of 3.X (without some hardware trickery).

**This guide will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, and 2DS in the U, ~~E~~, and ~~J~~ regions (coming soon). The C, K, and T regions shipped with version 4.X which is after the OTP lockout, and as such *cannot* downgrade far enough to use this guide.**

C, K, and T regions may be able to switch to U, E, or J temporarily but that is outside of the scope of this guide.

Once you have your (*and only your, OTPs cannot be shared between 3DSs under any circumstance*) OTP, you can check [here](https://github.com/delebile/arm9loaderhax) for information on arm9loaderhax, an exploit that requires it.

This guide was written by me with the process refined and software developed by the fine folks over at #Cakey on Freenode. See the bottom of this page for the full credits, this guide would not exist without them.
