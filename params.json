{"name":"OTP Guide - r2","tagline":"Downgrade to v2.1 on all regions for both o3DS and n3DS to get your console specific OTP.","body":"*While not a requirement anymore, a hardmod is still recommended.*\r\n\r\nThis guide should work without a hardmod in a relatively safe way. Thanks to the downgrades being done in emuNAND and a python script automating some of the risky edits for the New 3DS, the guide is mostly safe for use without a hardmod.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to attempt this without one, know that there may be some issues in the first couple days after the release of this revision and you should wait a while to ensure no serious errors made their way into the guide.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is, to the best of my knowledge, the first public comprehensive guide to getting the console specific OTP for the 3DS.\r\n\r\nThis guide will take you through the steps of downgrading to version 2.1 to get the OTP, which was blocked from our reach with the release of 3.X (without some hardware trickery).\r\n\r\n**This guide will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, and 2DS in the U, E, and J regions. The C, K, and T regions shipped with version 4.X which is after the OTP lockout, and as such *cannot* downgrade far enough to use this guide.**\r\n\r\nC, K, and T regions may be able to switch to U, E, or J temporarily but that is outside of the scope of this guide.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your (*and only your, OTPs cannot be shared between 3DSs under any circumstance*) OTP, you can check [here](https://github.com/delebile/arm9loaderhax) for information on arm9loaderhax, an exploit that requires it. **Arm9loaderhax will not do anything on its own, please wait for the release of software to work with this exploit.**\r\n\r\nThis guide was written by me with the process refined and software developed by the fine folks over at #Cakey on Freenode. See the bottom of this page for the full credits, this guide would not exist without them.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n\r\n*Click the appropriate link below:*\r\n\r\nNew 3DS | Old 3DS / 2DS\r\n:---: | :---:\r\n[With Cubic Ninja](https://github.com/Plailect/OTP/blob/master/New_3DS_Cubic.md) | [With Cubic Ninja](https://github.com/Plailect/OTP/blob/master/Old_3DS_Cubic.md)\r\n[Without Cubic Ninja](https://github.com/Plailect/OTP/blob/master/New_3DS_Spider.md) | [Without Cubic Ninja](https://github.com/Plailect/OTP/blob/master/Old_3DS_Spider.md)\r\n\r\nPack | SHA-256\r\n:---: | :---:\r\nNew_3DS_Cubic_U | d365b7c952ebe767e81ac2ce7ccf30cc4b0442c28b0871b8a03657f7deb3af13\r\nNew_3DS_Cubic_E | fc0e59728f1096fd65d5d1bfc25232f1993154c4916e8a9a26232e30a1718812\r\nNew_3DS_Cubic_J | 4ac3018593db6a08c5dd4c6309c5d1f6d95a7fe64d4f447e8956980543691577\r\nOld_3DS_Cubic_U | 3ec9823a8a8bde427ee6622ca54f9d2c15abc7975eb45925ade3b7ca74d9504b\r\nOld_3DS_Cubic_E | f4482ce9eea77a6c89d84237d49c0a647b12961e07d4d77f037a87bbb9121612\r\nOld_3DS_Cubic_J | 0c43a5da1ae0fbc799b2ca0467196989251b7d9f489236efb5802b7fead72c07\r\nNew_3DS_Spider_U | d2969a406337c5c15c044d6cbb9feb55fa54b169a282f6b331b4afcf1052a298\r\nNew_3DS_Spider_E | 5907913920a19380702bd3f5c21a8f81fe4906ae4186a3268cb865e7fcb835ec\r\nNew_3DS_Spider_J | 60c8fc76370e3a19cd2c26d20f0d02553c57635bd748c4f2b51fdf79d43d3644\r\nOld_3DS_Spider_U | 755b2b761a7163d79b5dd6b6499b24ad9137d447a6c8719dacd68799a24bfa68\r\nOld_3DS_Spider_E | e5c742fe8819aefaddb40d5869f91bdf5ba7c4b4e1dc09a2a0f1a1982aaafe78\r\nOld_3DS_Spider_J | 755b2b761a7163d79b5dd6b6499b24ad9137d447a6c8719dacd68799a24bfa68\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n+ AHP_Person for code.bin\r\n+ Normmatt for load.bin\r\n+ yellows8 for answering my questions\r\n+ b1l1s (he's back baby) for being fucking amazing\r\n+ mid-kid for letting us use his channel\r\n+ Gelex for being fucking amazing\r\n+ dank101 for testing\r\n+ Vappy for emotional support\r\n+ MassExplosion123 for answering questions\r\n+ Psi-Hate for testing\r\n+ Shadowtrance for answering questions and testing\r\n+ icecream for testing\r\n+ s_99 for emotional support\r\n+ dukesrg for hosting\r\n+ all of #Cakey on Freenode for being awesome\r\n\r\n*If I forgot you here, contact me and I'll add your name.*\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
